# Game Client Script

## Description

This script handles various client-side player actions after the 'FirstScript' has been executed.

## Game Services

### Services Used

- `GuiService`: Manages GUI-related functionalities.
- `Players`: Provides access to player-related information and functions.
- `ReplicatedFirst`: Manages replication of assets to the client before the player joins the game.
- `ReplicatedStorage`: Stores assets that need to be replicated between the server and client.
- `StarterGui`: Manages the player's initial GUI.
- `SoundService`: Manages in-game sounds.
- `TweenService`: Manages tweening animations.

## Settings

### Device

- `DeviceBreakPoint`: The pixel width at which the game toggles to using PC as the device.

### Interface

- `FadeDuration`: The duration of fade transitions in seconds.
- `TitleBackgroundScrollDuration`: The duration of one scrolling round of the title screen background in seconds.

## Instance Variables

### Folders

- `remotes`: Reference to the "Remotes" folder in `ReplicatedStorage`.

### Camera

- `currentCamera`: Reference to the workspace's current camera.

### Connections

- `gameLoadedRemote`: Reference to the "GameLoaded" remote event inside the "Remotes" folder.

### Player

- `player`: Reference to the local player.
- `playerGui`: Reference to the player's GUI.

### Sound

- `music`: Reference to the "Music" sound object inside `SoundService`.

## Preset Values

### Device

- `device`: Stores the current device type, initialized to "Mobile".

### Interface

- `screenGui`: Reference to the active screen GUI.

### Coroutines

- `asyncList`: Table containing active asynchronous functions.
- `asyncStats`: Table containing status information for asynchronous functions.

## Calculated Values

### Device

- `getDeviceType()`: Function that determines the device type used by the player.

### Interface

- `setScreenGui()`: Function to update the active screen GUI based on the device.

## Functions

### Coroutines

- `startAsync(functionObject, parameters)`: Starts an asynchronous function with optional parameters.
- `isAsyncRunning(asyncName)`: Returns the status of an asynchronous function.
- `stopAsync(functionObject)`: Stops a running asynchronous function.

### Interface

- `startFade(transparency, duration)`: Darkens the screen for transition effects.
- `scrollTitleBackground(asyncName)`: Scrolls the title screen background.
- `flashText(flashTextLabel, transparency, duration)`: Creates a flashing effect on a text label.

### Game

- `loadPlayer()`: Continues loading the game from where 'FirstScript' left off.

## Connections

- `gameLoadedRemote.Event:Connect(loadPlayer)`: Connects the `loadPlayer()` function to the "GameLoaded" remote event.

# Custom Loading Screen Script

## Code Description

This script is used to display a custom loading screen and disable core GUI elements. It also disables controls during the loading process.

## Game Services

The script uses the following game services:

- `GuiService`: Manages GUI-related operations.
- `Players`: Manages player-related information.
- `ReplicatedFirst`: Provides access to assets that should be available before loading screen.
- `ReplicatedStorage`: Stores assets that should be available across the game.
- `StarterGui`: Manages core GUI elements.
- `TweenService`: Handles animations and transitions.

## Settings

These are the adjustable settings within the script:

### Interface

- `LoadCircleDelay`: Time interval between load circle rotation steps (in seconds).
- `LoadCircleStep`: Number of degrees the load circle rotates per step.
- `LoadscreenMinDuration`: Minimum duration the replacement loading screen must be visible (in seconds).
- `FadeDuration`: Duration of fade transitions (in seconds).

## Instance Variables

Instance variables hold paths and objects used in the script. They include folders, connections, player-related variables, and GUI elements.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be run at various points. They include asynchronous coroutine-related functions and functions for managing the loading screen and transitions.

### Coroutines

- `startAsync(functionObject, parameters)`: Starts an asynchronous function with optional parameters.
- `isAsyncRunning(asyncName)`: Returns the status of a running asynchronous function.
- `stopAsync(functionObject)`: Stops a running asynchronous function.

### Interface

- `spinLoadCircle(asyncName, parameters)`: Spins the load circle of the custom loading screen asynchronously.
- `replaceRobloxLoadscreen()`: Replaces the default Roblox loading screen with the custom one.
- `startFade(transparency, duration)`: Darkens the screen for transition effects.

### Game

- `loadGame()`: Displays the custom loading screen, disables controls, and manages transitions.

## Connections

Connections bind events to functions. In this script, the `loadGame()` function is called immediately to initiate the loading process.

*Note: The script appears to be written in Lua for use within Roblox. Make sure to properly integrate it into your Roblox game's codebase.*
